The visual elements for this piece are generated from a single photo through an iterative corruptive process commonly known as datamoshing. The audio is generated by converting the raw data from my computer's cache into audio and thereafter resampling to fit the duration of the video. The generative nature of the video means results will very from instance to instance - it should work with other source photos as well! Due to the corrupted nature of the file's data, it may not open in your preferred media viewer - I've tested it with VLC media player, QuickTime player (though it throws a warning upon opening) and [IINA](https://github.com/iina/iina). Different decoders will reveal slightly different versions of the piece.

Requires: [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) / sclang, [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)
